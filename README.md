This is an E-Portfolio of our first main project of the Programme we are taking.

AccentNav is the repository for the app we developed as a group. It is an app that takes in any audio that you're saying and guesses your native language based on your accent when you're speaking English.

Here are some of the accents it will be able to detect:
American
Australian
British
Swedish
Indian
