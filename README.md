AccentNav is the repository for the app we developed as a group. It is an ANDROID app that takes in any audio that you're saying and guesses your native language based on your accent when you're speaking English. You can record you own voice samples within the app to do this or you can upload pre recorded voice samples from your device.

You have to simply open up the app, allow the required permissions, and hold the microphone icon to record. The longer you record, the more accurate of a result you will receive. Do note that there is a minimum recording duration of 5 seconds.

Here are some of the accents it will be able to detect:
*American
*Australian
*British
*Swedish
*Indian
*German
*Arabic

We used python code for the back-end of the app which is the AI model that takes in your voice samples and makes an accurate estimate of what accent you have. It also gives you this in percentages, showing most likely what accent you might have to the least likely.

The front end of the android app is coded mainly in Java and XML as that is what Android Studio uses which is the platform we used when developing the app.
Within there you will also find a few branches related to the nearly complete iOS version of the app we are currently working on.
However, everything related to the finished ANDROID app is on the main branch and any code you may want to check out or explore is well commented and explained.
